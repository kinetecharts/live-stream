I've attached my Blood glucose info from both a week in full and from a month in a simplified 
version, where I have isolated more important information from each day. 

- here is some info on the significance of the numbers

For the week there is 288 blood glucose readings each day. 

In general for someone with diabetes 

lower than 80 is low blood sugar: shaky, hungry, weak
80-150 is the target range (ideally 80-120)
higher than 150 is high blood sugar: thirsty, tired, stomach ache, frequent urination.

55 is usually the lowest number you'll see which is a veey low blood sugar and anywhere 
upwards of three hundred which is a very high blood sugar.  

The up and down column is describing the speed of rising or lowering bg, which is its' own 
metric. You may want to ignore this.

I wasn't sure if the dancers were controlling the data visualizations or responding to them.  
It would be exciting to experience my health data in this form and it is aligned with many of 
my goals and ways I see data becoming more accessible, creative, and engaging 

If you have questions about the significance of the data let me know- there is a lot of nuance 
to interpreting diabetes data sometimes depending on what you are looking for.

Bio
My mission is to merge art and technology with a focus on personal wellness. Using my art and 
design expertise, I create 3D printed medical data visualizations for myself and others living 
with type 1 diabetes to translate confusing charts and graphs into customized, handheld forms. 
My Diabetes Data Sculptures were featured at Stanford School of Medicine, Livongo Health, and 
in articles by DiabetesMine and Medscape, he is currently the Maker in Residence at the 
Chicago Public Library Maker Lab. 

Cheers!
